# Password Generator
Create your own password generator using jQuery, Vanilla JS, and SASS.

I have been working with JS for my last few projects so I thought I would dive into a JavaScript project. In this video, we learn how to build a secure password generator using JavaScript and SASS only.

This password generator can help you create your own safe and secure passwords using random functions within jQuery and vanilla JavaScript. You will be able to dictate the length of the password and whether it contains uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers....all or just one. It is a quick and easy project that does not require a server and can be done by an experienced developer or a new developer. You can view the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLJFeWr1juQ
